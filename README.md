# React Hooks Demo

## 📋 Overview

This project is a simple React application that demonstrates the use of fundamental React Hooks, including **useState**, **useEffect**, **useMemo**, and **useCallback**. These hooks are used to manage state, handle side effects, optimize performance, and prevent unnecessary re-renders.
